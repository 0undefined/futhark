Since the paper "A T2 Graph-Reduction Approach To Fusion" was written,
the Futhark language and compiler has changed.  This file attempts to
document the changes in order for the paper to remain a usable
resource.

(Most notably, the language was called "L0" in the paper.)

Language changes
---

  * The syntax for arrays and tuples have changed.  Array literals are
    now written with square brackets, as in: [1,2,3].  The syntax for
    array types has not changed.  Tuples are always written with curly
    braces: {1,2,3} is a tuple of three integers.  The tuple type
    syntax has likewise changed: the type of the just mentioned tuple
    would be {int,int,int}.  This is motivated by enabling
    singleton-tuples, which makes some transformations more
    convenient.

  * map2, reduce2, filter2, scan2 and redomap2 are now named mapT,
    reduceT, filterT, scanT, redomapT.  The old nomenclature was
    confusing: many people thought that map2 was a map that accepted
    just two arrays, and it was clumsy to talk about nested maps using
    a typical squaring syntax.  mapT^2 is more understandable than
    map2^2, especially on a whiteboard (where you'd often abbreviate
    to just map^2).

  * reduceT and scanT now require curly braces around their initial
    accumulator values.  That is, we went from

      reduceT(f, x,y,z, a, b, z)

    to

      reduceT(f, {x,y,z}, a, b, z).

    Note that this is not just a tuple expression, but an actual part
    of the reduceT syntax.  It is still syntactically required that
    the number of elements in the "tuple" equals the number of input
    arrays.

Compiler changes
---

  * Tuple-SOACS (mapT et al) now use a proper assertion mechanism
    rather than assertZip.
